<form action="/view_post" method="GET"><!--Using the Get method right now for debugging
but can always change to post when we are ready for production -->
<!--we are going to be populating this form by iterating through the data that was returned
from the query
form was sent in with a parameter called user_list
as we interate through each line in user_list, for each line we are going to be
printing out a radio button
the name is poster, and we are going to be sending a name value pair with poster and the
name of the person who posted
and then we have the username that was sent in from our query, remember the query was selecting
distinct username, so we have a username attribute here-->

<!--again we have the double curly braces to indicate that were taking a value from something that was
sent in to our template as a parameter
	*and we are also going to be printing out as the text that goes with that choice, the persons
 	 name
 * and this is going to iterate through and do that for each person-->
{% for line in user_list %}
<input type="radio" name="poster" value={{line.username}}>{{line.username}}</input>

{% endfor %}
